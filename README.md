## How to Use

Game masters:

- create a room
- share the room code with their friends
- have their friends join the room lobby
- let the app know that all your friends are in the room lobby
- then everyone will be transferred to a "room" where they can start rolling the dice and everyone will get the results!

## Contributing

Assuming you have [flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) already in your machine, just run `flutter run`. ðŸŽ‰

If you are interested in this project, (there _are_ a lot of UI bugs), feel free to make a PR. 

If you want to contribute but don't know flutter, I know a couple [resources](#learning-flutter) for learning flutter. ðŸ¤“

### Tests

I'm focusing lately on Python and so you'd notice there aren't any existing tests for this flutter app. However, if you do make a PR, tests are always appreciated!

## Learning Flutter

Sometimes [Google](https://flutter.dev/) provides a free basic video course so you might want to subscribe to their newsletter.

[Flutter's official YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwXdFgeE9KYzlDdR7TG9cMw) is very informative. 

There's a "5-hour Flutter Crash Course for Beginners 2021" in [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0uinJvhNxI). ðŸ¥³

There's [ResoCoder](https://resocoder.com/) and [FilledStacks](https://www.filledstacks.com/) that provide very informative tutorials and videos for free.

appbrewery.co has an affordable course on Flutter if you want something more systematic and guided; they have a Discord community where you can get a lot of help once you enroll.
