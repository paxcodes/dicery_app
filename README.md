An ongoing project.

# Dicery

Roll the dice with your friends. This is useful when remotely playing role-playing table-top games such as GURPS / Dungeons & Dragons. Game masters:

- create a room
- share the room code with their friends
- have their friends join the room

Let the app know that all your friends are in the room, then anyone can start rolling the dice and everyone will get the results!
